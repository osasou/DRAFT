Decoder.mに付け足したproutのplotをコメントアウトにして，
DRAFTを進めていきたい．
5ユーザでm=8くらいで，パケット分けて送ってEMアルゴ使ってクラスタリングして，その結果を示したい！いや，示さないと...


2020/11/29
Decoder.mにproutを図で表示するplotを追加した．
コメントアウトにしないと，めちゃくちゃ図が出てしまうので注意．

tester.mでm=3 user_num=2でEncoder.m のメッセージを固定化したパターンをやってみた


2020/11/29(日)
とりあえず，RM符号の復号の証明をしていた．それを論文にも書いているところ．
多分，プログラムは11/8から変わってない．
一応，これで削ぎ落せるところをそぎ落としたと思う．
あとは，このプログラムを各ユーザで通信路hを固定して，EMアルゴを適用していく研究を進めていくのかな．．．

2020/11/8(日)
Decoder.mの必要なさそうなところを消していく
treeのところ消した


2020/11/6(金)
結局，真値に直して進めるのかどうかが分からなかったため，とりあえず，真値に直してやっていくことにする
Decoder.mから復号の証明をしていくしかないかな．．．

Decoder.mのすべてを確認するのは厳しいから，次のone_slot_2_0からDecoder.mの必要なさそうなところを消していく．



2020/10/24(土)
重大なことに気がついた
荒木さんとのEbN0を比べていたら，自分の方が，dBを真値に直していなかった...
その結果，ちゃんとm=9でuser3で40dBくらいまでいけばちゃんと下がる！

compare_bitsはinputのすべてのメッセージが同じで，outputの一つがinputと同じくほかが全く違う場合でも，
propfoundは1になるから，すべて違うメッセージであるというのが前提！
